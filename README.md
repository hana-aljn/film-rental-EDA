# Film Rental EDA - Internship Task

**🎯 Project Purpose:**
This repository contains a solution I developed as part of a data science internship application task.  
The main goal of the task was to analyze a film rental dataset to gain insights into customer behavior and rental trends. Specifically, the project focuses on:

- Understanding customer rental behavior
- Identifying popular films and rental trends
- Exploring data structure and quality
- Applying machine learning for pattern discovery

---

**📦 Libraries & Tools Used:**

The following Python packages are used in this project:
- *NumPy* → Numerical computations
- *Pandas* → Data manipulation and tabular structures
- *Matplotlib* → Data visualization
- *Seaborn* → Statistical visualizations
- *Scikit-learn* → Machine Learning algorithms
- *MySQL Connector* → Database connectivity

---

**🤖 Machine Learning Models Applied:**

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier

---

**🗄️ Database Integration:**

The notebook demonstrates data handling by connecting to a MySQL database using:
*mysql.connector*

This allows:

1- Querying structured data

2- Loading SQL data into pandas DataFrames

---

**💡 Skills Demonstrated:**

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization and pattern identification  
- Machine learning model implementation and evaluation  
- SQL database querying and integration
